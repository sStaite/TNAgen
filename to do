To do:

    delete extra files for models that are not being used - also, get git lfs working!

    look at paper jade sent - generate the whistle glitch from a mathematical formula

    realistic SNR 
    look into amplitude of graph - where are there only two spikes???

    Otsu's thresholding:
        read about it
        check it works in all glitch cases
        openCV is too big! write own script (in C or Cython?)


Notes:

## Git LFS
Git LFS will be a good option for the models - 19 models that take up about 1.06gb of space. Unfortunately I have used over 1gb so github banned me for a month from using it.

## Installation
A Conda environment must be used - this is because python-framel (the python package that is used to write data to .gwf files) can only be managed by Conda. 
Annoyingly, torchGAN can only be installed via pip. This means the requirements are stored in a requirements.yml file. 

Installed with conda:
pytorch
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
librosa, libvorbis (this was need for some reason? even though its a dependency of librosa)
scipy
gwpy
python-framel
h5py

Installed with pip:
torchGAN

## Otsu's method
This seems like it could work - but the only package that has it is openCV, and it works well, but its 200mb. The plan is/was to write my own function in C
that does the cleaning - however, as my mac has an M1 chip in it, the conda environment seems not to like importing C code so that isn't currently working
