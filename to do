To do:

    delete extra files for models that are not being used - also, get git lfs working!

    look at paper jade sent - generate the whistle glitch from a mathematical formula

    realistic SNR 
    look into amplitude of graph - where are there only two spikes???

    Otsu's thresholding:
        read about it
        check it works in all glitch cases
        openCV is too big! write own script (in C or Cython?)
